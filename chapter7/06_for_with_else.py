# For loop with else
# Example of a for loop with else statement
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
else: 
    #this is just for example other wise this code can be more refined and there is no need of this else statement here. Since the next print is automatically picked by python to execute 
    print("Done!")

# More refined example for the same code as above
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
print("Done!")
