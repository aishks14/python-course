# variable names can be started from a letter or underscore, but not a number, or any other special character
# Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number.
# Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning 'a' and 'A' are different variables.   
# Variable names cannot be the same as Python keywords (e.g., 'if', 'else', 'while', etc.).
# Variable names can be any length, but should be descriptive enough to indicate their purpose.
# Variable names can include underscores, but cannot contain spaces or special characters (except for underscores).
