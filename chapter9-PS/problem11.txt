Python File Input/Output (I/O)

Python provides built-in functions to work with files. The most commonly used function is `open()`, which allows you to read from or write to a file.

Basic Syntax:
open(filename, mode)

Modes:
- 'r'  : Read (default mode)
- 'w'  : Write (overwrites existing content)
- 'a'  : Append (adds to the end of the file)
- 'r+' : Read and write
- 'w+' : Write and read (overwrites)
- 'a+' : Append and read

Reading from a file:
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

Writing to a file:
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("This is a new line of text.")

Appending to a file:
with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("\nThis line is added at the end.")

Always use 'with' to ensure the file is properly closed after use.

Binary Mode:
Use 'rb', 'wb', or 'ab' to work with binary files like images or audio.

Example:
with open('image.png', 'rb') as img:
    data = img.read()

File I/O is essential for tasks like logging, data storage, and configuration management.
