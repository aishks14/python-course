# WAP in python to change the values inside a list which is contained inside a set

#my_set = {8, 15, 5, "Python", ["List", "Inside", "Set", 1, 2]} 
#TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'. This is because lists are mutable and cannot be used as elements in a set.   
# Note: Sets in Python cannot contain mutable types like lists directly, as they are unhashable.
# Therefore, we cannot directly include a list inside a set.
